The end goal is to have automated groundwater level updates every day and to be able to calculate groundwater recharge from the water level data."

    "text": "Welcome to CalGRO!!!\n\nIn the recharge tab:\nEstimating ground water recharge using the water-table fluctuation (WTF) method https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/gwrp/methods/wtf/. We are assuming the extrapolated antecedent recession curve is continuous with the water depth at start date, since we do not have any dry season historic data to base our measurements on.\nSpecific yield is especially hard to estimate. Not all wells have good lithologic data or well logs. https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1662d/report.pdf is used to estimate Specific yield. This was the best resource available. Originally publish in the 60â€™s. Since well logs are not available for all preserves I used DWR to estimate based on nearby well logs. https://dwr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=181078580a214c0986e2da28f8623b37\nRandall = granite and quartz, Dangermond = Shale Las Piletas = Clay, Shale, Sandstone Santa Cruz island = hard gravel with sandstone Santa Paula = sand, gravel, clay\ngranite specific yield = 0.01-0.03 Shale Specific Yield = 0.01-0.03 Sandstone Specific Yield = 0.05-0.1 gravel specific yield = 0.12-0.35 (depends on coarseness and if mixed with sand)\nIn the Well depth and Rainfall tab:\nEach storm is considered consecutive days with 0.1 or more inches of rain. For each storm the change in well depth and total rainfall is calculated and plotted.",
