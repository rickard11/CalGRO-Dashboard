We are assuming the extrapolated antecedent recession curve is continuous with the water depth at start date, since we do not have any dry season historic data to base our measurements on.\nIn the Well depth and Rainfall tab:\nEach storm is considered consecutive days with 0.1 or more inches of rain. For each storm the change in well depth and total rainfall is calculated and plotted.",
