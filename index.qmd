Welcome to CalGRO!!!

In the recharge tab:

Estimating ground water recharge using the water-table fluctuation (WTF) method https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/gwrp/methods/wtf/. We are assuming the extrapolated antecedent recession curve is continuous with the water depth at start date, since we do not have any dry season historic data to base our measurements on.

In the Well depth and Rainfall tab:

Each storm is considered consecutive days with 0.1 or more inches of rain. For each storm the change in well depth and total rainfall is calculated and plotted.
